# PMF-NEChina-40D-GEE
We present PMF-NEChina-40D, the first dataset mapping plastic-mulched farmlands in Northeast China from 1985–2025. Using multi-sensor Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery on Google Earth Engine, we developed a dual-temporal film-on/film-off mapping framework to generate long-term PMF dynamics.
